# Dehydrated Route 53 Hook Script
This is a Dehydrated hook script that employs cli53 to enable dns-01 challenges with AWS Route 53 DNS hosting. The advantage of the dns-01 challenge is that doesn't require a web server or even for the server to be Internet accessible. Only the DNS hosting needs to be Internet accessible and have an API. So you can even request a certificate from an internal server which you only use internally.

```

The `hook.sh` script can be used in conjunction with [`dehydrated`](https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated) and Let's Encrypt's service (letsencrypt.org) to issue SSL certificates for domain names hosted in [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). The script is based on the dehydrated `hook.sh` template, and heavily leverages the excellent [`cli53` Route 53 client](https://github.com/barnybug/cli53). It is designed to be called by the `dehydrated` script to create and delete dns-01 challenge records.

The script will automatically identify the correct Route 53 zone for each domain name. It also supports certificates with alternative domain names in different Route 53 zones

## Dependencies

The script requires the following tools, all of which should be in your Linux distro, except probably `cli53` which is a single standalone binary with no dependencies.
- [cli53](https://github.com/barnybug/cli53)
- bash
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- sed
- xargs
- mailx (just for emailing errors)

This script will only work if `dehydrated` if using the following `config` settings.
```
CHALLENGETYPE="dns-01"
HOOK="./hook.sh"
HOOK_CHAIN="no"
```

`cli53` requires an AWS user access key (more details below).

You need to create a scheduled task (e.g. cron) to ensure your certificates are renewed regularly (more details below).

## AWS Route 53 IAM User and Policy

For `cli53` to work, it requires an AWS user access key with access to Route 53, with permissions
to list zones, and to create and delete records in zones. Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables, or create `~/.aws/credentials` file with `[default]` credentials, or set `AWS_PROFILE` to name of a credentials entry in `~/.aws/credentials`.

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIA1234567890124567
aws_secret_access_key = FakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE
```

You can and should create an AWS IAM user, and attach just the minimum policy needed to support the dns-01 challenge process. You can either attached the standard 'AmazonRoute53FullAccess' policy, or you can create a more limited policy such as below and attach that.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:ListHostedZones",
                "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
                "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:ListResourceRecordSets",
                "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:GetChange"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::change/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

You could restrict this even further by listing only specific Route 53 zone Id's in, e.g.

```
"Resource": [ 
    "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/Z12345678901", 
    "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/Z12345678901" ]
```

## Scheduled Task for Renewals (cron)

Let's Encrypt certificate expire after 90 days, so you should create a cron task to check and renew the certificates if they will expire soon.

```
@daily /etc/dehydrated/dehydrated --cron  >/dev/null  #Check and renew SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt
```

## Restart Web Servers for Renewed Certificates 

Most services won't load any renewed certificate files until they are restarted or signaled to reload, sometimes because they have dropped priviledges and can no longer read their configuration files. You can extend the `deploy_cert` function in the hook script restart services or copy/load certificates into the right places, whenever a new or renewed certificate is created. Below is a simple example to restart apache on CentOS/RHEL 6. Change the sudo commands to suit other distros. 

```
deploy_cert() {
    local DOMAIN="${1}" KEYFILE="${2}" CERTFILE="${3}" FULLCHAINFILE="${4}" CHAINFILE="${5}" TIMESTAMP="${6}"

    # Restart apache to read the new certificate files
    # Requires that user running dehydrated has sudoer rights to execute the right commands, e.g
    # dehydrated ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/service httpd configtest, /sbin/service httpd graceful

    # Only restart apache if the configuration is valid
    echo -n "Checking apache config: "
    sudo service httpd configtest
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
      echo "Restarting apache to read the new certificate files for ${DOMAIN}"
      sudo service httpd graceful
    else
      (>&2 echo "Skipping restarting apache because apache config is invalid") 
    fi
}
```

## Limitations

`dehydrated` does not tell the hook script the challenge type, so this hook script has to assume every domain name is using a dns-01 challenge.
